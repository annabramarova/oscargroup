Simply put, if we have financial difficulties with one startup, we can compensate for this through profits from others.

These funds represent 100% of Oskar Group's initial investment in startups, and according to company documents, the share of owners in operating investment activities should never be less than 51% of the total investment that the company can attract. Thus, the founders of our company are not only guarantors of its activities, but also ensure stability of payments for investors, guaranteeing their own investments.
